# scala-learning

This is a collection of small projects in Scala that I have implemented in order to learn Scala.

1. [md2html](md2html/README.md) - markdown to HTML converter.
2. [irc_client](irc_client/README.md) - simple IRC client.
3. [wikipedia_live](wikipedia_live/README.md) - dashboard to monitor Wikipedia edits in real time using apache Spark Streaming.
